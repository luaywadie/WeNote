## Installing Dependencies
1) Use git clone or download a zip version of the application.
- Extract if ZIP file
2) Using a terminal, navigate to server and install npm dependencies by typing `npm install`.
3) Using another terminal window, navigate to client and install npm dependencies by typing `npm install`.

## Running the server and client (Terminal)
1) While inside the server folder, run `node server` to start the node server. It should say Listening to port: 3000.
2) Navigate to the client folder, run `npm start` to launch the application. Currently the sample username is Luay and password is 123.
- If they don't work, you may register a new account by clicking the plus sign on the login screen (Bottom Right).
  - If you register, be informed that note creation is currently under development, only visible notes are under the primary username Luay.
3) Currently the server will log actions such as:
  - Logging in
  - Editing a notes file

I would recommend checking the server terminal window to see these in actions.
